======================================
Cloud Services Notifications (Cloudsn)
======================================

This application is a daemon checking the configured accounts for
new messages. It uses the indicator-applet to show the accounts and
the current unreaded items. It uses libnotify to show notifications
when new messages are detected.

Currently the application has these providers implemented:

* Gmail: Check for new e-mails in the inbox or configured folders
* Google Reader: Check for unread feeds
* Twitter: Show new tweets
* Identi.ca: Show new messages
* RSS: Show new posts
* IMAP: Check for new e-mails in the inbox or configured folders

The application has (or will have) an MVC model to support new providers
like pop3, imap, tweeter, facebook, etc. The application will have
support for multiple notifications (use libnotify, e-mail, popup, etc). By 
the moment it use libnotify only.

Cloudsn has a centralized preferences manager. The user will have an unique 
preferences dialog for global preferences and new/edit/delete accounts for
all providers.
